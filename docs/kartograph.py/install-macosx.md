# Installing Kartograph.py on Mac OS X

*soon to come*.

In the meantime some useful tips:

* Before installing Kartograph, install the complete GDAL Framework as provided by William Kyngesburye on kyngchaos.com: [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks). This will add a lot libraries to your system that are needed in order to compile shapely.
* Speaking about shapely, this [installation guide](http://tumblr.pauladamsmith.com/post/17663153373/howtoinstallgdalshapely) might help you getting it running on Mac OS.
* Since during the install Python will need to compile packages, make sure that you have a working compiler on your system. Installing XCode with the Command line Utils helps.
