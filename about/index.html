		<h1>The magic behind Kartograph</h1>
		

		<p>The core concept of Kartograph is to separate the mapping process in the map generation and map rendering part. The client-side library <a href="/about/kartograph.js/">kartograph.js</a> renders pre-generated maps stored in SVG files. You can chose among hundrets of ready-to-use maps or simply generate your own using <a href="/about/kartograph.py/">kartograph.py</a>, the open source Python SVG map generator.</p>
		<p>The Kartograph framework essentially consists of two major parts. The first is a Python library to generate SVG maps from various geodata sources (shapefiles, KML, GeoJson). By '<em>generate</em>' we mean that the geodata is filtered, projected, generalized, joined, cropped and finally stored as vector graphics.</p>
		<p>The second part is a JavaScript library that will load and render the SVG map in any web browser. </p>
		<p>Kartograph is written in Python and JavaScript (CoffeeScript, acutally). </p>

		<p> A typical process of creating a map using Kartograph looks like this: The first thing you do is to generate a SVG map from the source geo data, which is mostly boundary shapefiles. You can choose a map projection and tweak on a few parameters. Once you're done with that you go one and load the SVG into your web application. That's where the Kartograph JavaScript library comes in.</p>
