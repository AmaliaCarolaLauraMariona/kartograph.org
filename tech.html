		<p>Kartograph is part JavaScript and part Python. A typical process of creating a map using Kartograph looks like this: The first thing you do is to generate a SVG map from the source geo data, which is mostly boundary shapefiles. You can choose a map projection and tweak on a few parameters. Once you're done with that you go one and load the SVG into your web application. That's where the Kartograph JavaScript library comes in.</p>
