This is the source of the website running at http://kartograph.org.

This is a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> website, so you have to 
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install">install</a> and
run Jekyll it in the root directory. 

It will generate a folder "_site" which contains the fully rendered website.
Make this your document root and it should look fine.

You can also run it without a webserver using

jekyll --server
