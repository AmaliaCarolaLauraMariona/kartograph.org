        <h1>Why Kartograph?</h1>
        <p>Kartograph is a new framework for building interactive map applications without the need for Google Maps or any other mapping service. It was created with the needs of designers and data journalists in mind, or, in short, for people who want to tell data-driven stories using maps.</p>

        <p>Please check out the <a href="/showcase/">showcase section</a> to see what Kartograph can do for you or dive into the <a href="/tech.html">technical details</a> to learn more about it.</p>
        <h2>Current Progress</h2>
        <p>At the moment Kartograph is in an alpha-release stadium, which means that it basically works and is already used a lot by its author but there are some more things left to do to make it as easy-to-use for everybody else. As many other open source projects, Kartograph depends on donations.</p>
        <p>
        In contrast to many other available mapping frameworks, Kartograph frees you from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Spherical Mercator projection</a>, allowing you to choose whatever map projection is fitting your needs.

        </ul>
        <h2>And what's not in it?</h2>
        <p>Sorry, but the one thing Kartograph can’t do for you is tile maps. So, if you really, really need street-level details in your map, try one of the <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">other</a> <a href="http://polymaps.org">great</a> <a href="http://openlayers.org">mapping</a> <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/">frameworks</a>.</p>
